<h1>Welcome to Video Game Exchange!</h1>
<br />
<h4>What is Video Game Exchange?</h4>
<p>Video Game Exchange automatically sets up a trade for you with nearby gamers who own the game you want, and want the game you own.
   Stop getting ripped off by low trade-in values and get new games for the ones you don't play anymore!</p>

<h4>How does it work?</h4>
    <u>Once you're registered, setting up a trade is a simple three-step process:</u>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the "Propose New Trade" tab</li>
        <li>Enter the title of the game you own and want to trade away</li>
        <li>Enter the title of the game you want to receive in exchange for the game you own</li>
    </ol>
    Once you submit your proposed trade, Video Game Exchange will look for a proposed trade by another user who wants the game you own, and owns the game you want.
    If there is a match, it will show up on the "Matches" page. If you <a href="#">signed up for notifications</a>, you will also receive an email
    within minutes that a match has been found so you can get in contact with the other user right away.
