    <h1>About GameExchange.ca</h1>
    <p>Are you tired of paying almost $100 for a new video game, playing it for a month or two, then trading it in for $20 at your local video game store?
    GameExchange.ca alleviates that by allowing users to set up trades with other gamers who live nearby.

    <br /><br /><u>Setting up a trade is a simple three-step process:</u>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the "Propose New Trade" tab</li>
        <li>Enter the title and platform of the game you own and want to trade</li>
        <li>Enter the title and platform of the game you want to receive in exchange for the game you own</li>
    </ol>
    Once you submit your proposed trade, GameExchange.ca will look for a proposed trade by another gamer who wants the game you own, and owns the game you want.
    If there is a match for your proposed trade, it will show up in the "Your Matches" tab. If you signed up for notifications, you will also receive an email
    within minutes that a match has been found so you can get in contact with the other gamer right away.
    </p>
